--This script sets up access controls for Gradebook roles
-- it also creates a 'Gradebook' schema to store app-specific data and code

--This script should be run once in a database where Gradebook data is to be
--stored
-- multiple Gradebook DBs are possible on the same server even in deployment,
-- because as of now multi-tenancy is possible only through multiple DBs;
-- multiple DBs may also be needed during development and testing

--This script should be the first to run after creating the database
-- it should be run while the database is still empty

--This script should be run by a superuser
