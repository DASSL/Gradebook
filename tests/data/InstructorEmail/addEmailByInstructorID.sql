--This script adds e-mail address to instructors who don't already have one
-- constructs unique addresses using instructor ID;
-- assigns e-mail addresses of the form 'n@example.edu', where 'n' is an
-- instructor ID;
-- does not guarantee all instructors get an e-mail address, but guarantees
-- that any assigned address is unique

--The e-mail addresses assigned are syntactically valid, but are not real
-- addresses because the domain 'example.edu' cannot actually be registered: W3C
-- designates this domain for use only in examples

--Run the script addEmailByInstructorName.sql to add e-mail addresses based on
--instructor names instead of IDs


--suppress NOTICE and other lower messages from being displayed
SET client_min_messages TO WARNING;

--use a temporary table with an index to construct unique e-mail addresses

SELECT ID, CONCAT(ID, '@example.edu')

--transfer e-mail addresses from the temporary table to Gradebook
